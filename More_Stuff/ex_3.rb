# # What is exception handling and what problem does it solve?
# Exception handling is a way of mitigating bad data entering your program. This prevents
# the program from stopping before it has finished. If you can think of trouble spots in your
# program where this may occur you can have it throw an exception and continue the rest of the
# program.
