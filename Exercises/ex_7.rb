# # What's the major difference between an Array and a Hash?

# # The major difference between these two data structures is that a Hash uses
# key-value pairs where an array uses indexes. Also, prior to Ruby 1.9 and Array was used 
# to keep an ordered list where that order was not maintained in a Hash.
