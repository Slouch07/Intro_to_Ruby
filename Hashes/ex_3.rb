# Exercise 3 - Hashes

# Using some of Ruby's built-in Hash methods, write a program that loops through a hash
# and prints all of the keys.
og_hash = {dog: "Bark", cat: "Meow", cow: "Moo"}
keys = og_hash.keys 
p keys

# Write a program that loops through a hash and prints all of the values.
values = og_hash.values
p values
