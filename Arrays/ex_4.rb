# Exercise 4 - Arrays
# What does each method return in the following examples?
arr = [15, 7, 18, 5, 12, 8, 5, 1]

1. arr.index(5) # Error --> corrected to 3 - returns the index number of the requested object.

2. arr.index[5] # 8 --> corrected to error

3. arr[5] # 8 - returns the value in the requested index.
